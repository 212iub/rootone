      <h2> Banned from the Roxy pt 1 </h2>
      <p> Banned from the ROXY? O.K. <br>
          Never liked playing there anyway <br>
          Said they only liked well behaved boys do they think guitars and microphones are just fucking toys? <br>
          Fuck 'em, I chosen to make my stand against what I feel is wrong with this land <br>
          They just sit there on their overfed arses feeding off the sweat of less fortunate classes <br>
          They keep their fucking power because their fingers on the button button, <br>
          They have the control and won't let it be forgotten

      <h2> Banned from the Roxy pt 2 </h2>
      <p> The truth of their reality is at the wrong end of the gun <br>
          The proof is Belfast and that's no fucking fun <br>
          Seeing the squaddy lying in the front yard <br>
          Seeing the machine guns resting on the fence <br>
          Finding the enterance to your own front yard is barred <br>
          They've got the nerve to call it defence <br>
          Seems their defence is just the threat of strength <br>
          Protection for the privileged at any length <br>
          The government protecting their profits from the poor <br>
          The rich and the fortunate chaining up the door <br>
          Afraid that the poor might ask for a little more than the shit they get
