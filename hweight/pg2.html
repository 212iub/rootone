      <h2> Picture of a sunflower </h2>
      <p> The sunflower (Helianthus annuus) is an annual plant with a large daisy-like flower face.
         Its scientific name comes from the Greek words helios (“sun”) and anthos (“flower”). The 
         flowers come in many colors (yellow, red, orange, maroon, brown), but they are commonly 
         bright yellow with brown centers that ripen into heavy heads filled with seeds.

      <h2> Banned from the Roxy pt 2 </h2>
      <p> The truth of their reality is at the wrong end of the gun <br>
          The proof is Belfast and that's no fucking fun <br>
          Seeing the squaddy lying in the front yard <br>
          Seeing the machine guns resting on the fence <br>
          Finding the enterance to your own front yard is barred <br>
          They've got the nerve to call it defence <br>
          Seems their defence is just the threat of strength <br>
          Protection for the privileged at any length <br>
          The government protecting their profits from the poor <br>
          The rich and the fortunate chaining up the door <br>
          Afraid that the poor might ask for a little more than the shit they get
