      <h2> Without using relative or absolute positioning, what is another way to position </h2>
      <p> Banned from the ROXY? O.K. <br>
          Never liked playing there anyway <br>
          Said they only liked well behaved boys do they think guitars and microphones are just fucking toys? <br>
          Fuck 'em, I chosen to make my stand against what I feel is wrong with this land <br>
          They just sit there on their overfed arses feeding off the sweat of less fortunate classes <br>
          They keep their fucking power because their fingers on the button button, <br>
          They have the control and won't let it be forgotten
