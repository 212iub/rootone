        <p>Anemone are perennials that have basal leaves with long leaf-stems that can be upright or prostrate.<br>
             Leaves are simple or compound with lobed, parted, or undivided leaf blades. The leaf margins are <br>
             toothed or entire. Flowers with 4–27 sepals are produced singly, in cymes of 2–9 flowers, or in <br>
             umbels, above a cluster of leaf- or sepal-like bracts. Sepals may be any color. The pistils have <br>
             one ovule. The flowers have nectaries, but petals are missing in the majority of species. The <br>
             fruits are ovoid to obovoid shaped achenes that are collected together in a tight cluster, ending <br>
             variously lengthened stalks; though many species have sessile clusters terminating the stems. The <br>
             achenes are beaked and some species have feathery hairs attached to them.
