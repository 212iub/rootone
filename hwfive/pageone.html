        <p>The peony or paeony is a flowering plant in the genus Paeonia, the only genus in the family Paeoniaceae.<br>
             Peonies are native to Asia, Europe and Western North America. Scientists differ on the number of species <br>
             that can be distinguished, ranging from 25 to 40, although the current consensus is 33 known species. <br>
             The relationships between the species need to be further clarified. Most are herbaceous perennial plants<br>
             0.25–1 metre (1–3 ft) tall, but some are woody shrubs 0.25–3.5 metres (1–11 ft) tall. They have compound,<br>
             deeply lobed leaves and large, often fragrant flowers, in colors ranging from purple and pink to red, <br>
             white or yellow, in late spring and early summer. The flowers have a short blooming season, usually only<br>
             7–10 days. Peonies are popular garden plants in temperate regions. Herbaceous peonies are also sold <br>
             as cut flowers on a large scale, although generally only available in late spring and early summer.<br>
