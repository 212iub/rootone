        <p>Hydrangea or hortensia, is a genus of over 75 species of flowering plants native to Asia and the Americas. <br>
            By far the greatest species diversity is in eastern Asia, notably China, Korea, and Japan. Most are <br>
            shrubs 1–3 m (3 ft 3 in – 9 ft 10 in) tall, but some are small trees, and others lianas reaching up to <br>
            30 m (100 ft) by climbing up trees. 
        </p>
        <p>They can be either deciduous or evergreen, though the widely cultivated <br>
            temperate species are all deciduous. Hydrangea is derived from Greek and means ‘water vessel’, in reference <br>
            to the shape of its seed capsules. The earlier name, Hortensia, is a Latinised version of the French given <br>
            name Hortense, honoring French astronomer and mathematician Nicole-Reine Hortense Lepaute.
