  <p> Argentina, country of South America, covering most of the southern portion of the continent. The world’s eighth
     largest country, Argentina occupies an area more extensive than Mexico and the U.S. state of Texas combined. 
     It encompasses immense plains, deserts, tundra, and forests, as well as tall mountains, rivers, and thousands
     of miles of ocean shoreline. Argentina also claims a portion of Antarctica, as well as several islands in the
     South Atlantic, including the British-ruled Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)Argentina has long played an 
     important role in the continent’s history. Following three centuries of Spanish colonization, Argentina 
     declared independence in 1816, and Argentine nationalists were instrumental in revolutionary movements 
     elsewhere, a fact that prompted 20th-century writer Jorge Luis Borges to observe, “South America’s
     independence was, to a great extent, an Argentine enterprise.” Torn by strife and occasional war between
     political factions demanding either central authority (based in Buenos Aires) or provincial autonomy, 
     Argentina tended toward periods of caudillo, or strongman, leadership, most famously under the presidency 
     of Juan Perón. The 1970s ushered in a period of military dictatorship and repression during which thousands
     of presumed dissidents were “disappeared,” or murdered; this ended in the disastrous Falklands Islands War 
     of 1982, when Argentina invaded the South Atlantic islands it claimed as its own and was defeated by British 
     forces in a short but bloody campaign. Defeat led to the fall of the military regime and the reestablishment 
     of democratic rule, which has since endured despite various economic crises. The country’s name comes from 
     the Latin word for silver, argentum, and Argentina is indeed a great source of valuable minerals. More 
     important, however, has been Argentina’s production of livestock and cereals, for which it once ranked among
     the world’s wealthiest nations. Much of this agricultural activity is set in the Pampas, rich grasslands 
     that were once the domain of nomadic Native Americans, followed by rough-riding gauchos, who were in turn 
     forever enshrined in the nation’s romantic literature. As Borges describes them in his story The South, the
     Pampas stretch endlessly to the horizon, dwarfing the humans within them; traveling from the capital toward 
     Patagonia, the story’s protagonist, Señor Dahlmann, “saw horsemen along dirt roads; he saw gullies and lagoons
     and ranches; he saw long luminous clouds that resembled marble; and all these things were casual, like dreams
     of the plain.... The elemental earth was not perturbed either by settlements or other signs of humanity. The 
     country was vast, but at the same time it was intimate and, in some measure, secret. The limitless country 
     sometimes contained only a solitary bull. The solitude was perfect and perhaps hostile, and it might have 
     occurred to Dahlmann that he was traveling into the past and not merely south.”
