        <p> Coastal redwoods or sequoia sempervirens can reach up to 379 feet (115 meters) and are the tallest living plant on the planet. Native to California, some of these giants have lived for over 2,000 years. Although the area they grow in was impacted by the CZU fires, these majestic trees are still standing.</p>

		<p> Most people think that carrots are orange but carrots were originally purple or white and were used as food as early as the 10th century in the Persian empire according to Healthline.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
