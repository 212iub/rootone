    <p> Lorem ipsum... But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and  
      praising pain was <br> born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and 
      expound the actual teachings <br> of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder
      of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, <br> or avoids pleasure itself, because it is
      pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue <br> pleasure rationally encounter 
      consequences that are extremely painful. </p>
